### 1.3 - `version`
###### required: `yes`
_If you are planning to deploy your plugins to a public
repository (excluding JitPack), it is vital (and generally
required) that this tag match best practices. I will describe
best practices as well as acceptable values and why it may
be easier to follow best practice in any case._

#### Best Practice
[SemVer](https://semver.org/)

#### Bare Minimum
Stick with `x.y` or `x.y.z`-form versions. Avoid using
`-SNAPSHOT` unless you understand its limitations.
