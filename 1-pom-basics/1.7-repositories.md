### 1.6 - `<repositories>`
###### required: `no, but strongly recommended`
#### This tag answers the simple question, "_Where_ are my dependencies hosted?"
### Repositories host `.jars` and source code
Many formal open-source software projects maintain their
artifacts using the Central Repository--a public, mirrored,
well-organized and highly accessible software repository
managed and maintained by its sponsor, Sonatype. In fact,
an artifact successfully deployed to the Central Repository
will be distributed and likely cached around the world in a
matter of days. This comes at a cost--**projects on Central
are held to a _higher standard_** when it comes to the
formatting of **metadata**, artifacts **must not use
snapshot versioning** and once a project has released a
version of an artifact **it becomes _very difficult_ to
replace or remove that artifact version** (This is done as
a matter of policy to ease administration of Central).

SpigotMC Pty. Ltd. maintains its own separate repository.
This enables them to serve artifacts using `-SNAPSHOT`
versions (which are treated as mutable by Maven) and thus
update any artifacts rapidly if needed (say for security
updates (Log4Shell who?)):
```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>spigotmc-repo</id>
            <url>https://hub.spigotmc.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
```

### If you are coding MC version `1.8` and up I recommend using Maven to manage dependency on the Spigot API
Let's see an example of this with both the `<repositories>`
and `<dependencies>` tags:
```xml
<project>
    <!-- in the pom.xml -->
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>spigotmc-repo</id>
            <url>https://hub.spigotmc.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.spigotmc</groupId>
            <artifactId>spigot-api</artifactId>
            <version>1.18.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```
##### This example is for MC version 1.18.1
The general format of the version string for Spigot's
`spigot-api` artifact is `[x.y](.z)-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`.
