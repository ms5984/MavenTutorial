## 1. Basics - The POM
Maven uses the file `pom.xml` to store project information.

POM stands for the Project Object Model; the `pom.xml` is thus
simply an XML representation of this model. XML tags are used
to organize project information required for the tasks Maven
performs, such as building artifacts or testing them.

We will first cover core tags required for any project,
briefly describe a few others and end with two tags that
you can expect to use heavily in Spigot development.

#### Core tags:
- [`<groupId>`](./1.1-group-id.md)
- [`<artifactId>`](./1.2-artifact-id.md)
- [`<version>`](./1.3-version.md)

##### [Other tags (optional/skipped)](./1.4-other.md)

#### Tags you can expect to use:
- [`<properties>`](./1.5-properties.md)
- [`<dependencies>`](./1.6-dependencies.md)
