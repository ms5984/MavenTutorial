### 1.4: Other common tags
#### [`<packaging>`](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#packaging)
###### required: `no`
For simple projects we can omit this tag. This tag controls
the type of file Maven is expected to produce for a given
module. `jar` is the default value and thus we can leave it
out; if you later you create multi-module projects you will
also use `pom` (it must be used for parent projects).

#### [`<modules>`](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#aggregation-or-multi-module)
###### required: `no`
For simple projects we must omit this tag. This tag is used
in an aggregator project to group together the building of
submodules.

#### [`<parent>`](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#inheritance)
###### required: `no`
For simple projects we can omit this tag. This tag is used
to configure inheritance from another `pom.xml`. You can
only configure one parent. The parent may or may not be an
aggregator project as well but must always use
`<packaging>pom</packaging>`.
