### 1.6 - `<dependencies>`
###### required: `no, but strongly recommended`
Plugins, by their definition, cannot be made without a copy
of the environment for which they are written. Spigot plugins
make no exception--we **must** have a copy of Spigot's API
in order for the computer to verify our plugin code. Spigot's
API is thus a _dependency_ of our project, and to describe
that relationship we supply the coordinates Spigot uses for
their project from their `pom.xml`:
```xml
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.spigotmc</groupId>
            <artifactId>spigot-api</artifactId>
            <version>1.18.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

We've already talked about [groupId](./1.1-group-id.md),
[artifactId](./1.2-artifact-id.md) and
[version](./1.3-version.md), but you might notice another
tag, `<scope>`.

### `<scope>`
This tag controls how we want to use a dependency. It has
three common options:
- `compile` - _The dependency will be packaged with the
project and available to projects downstream (projects that
use this project_
- `provided` - _The dependency will only be used for
compiling and testing, will not be packaged with the
project and thus will not be available downstream_
- `system` - _A local jar will be used for compiling and
testing and will not be packaged nor available downstream_

**Because the server `.jar` contains the Spigot API already,
it is not necessary (and in fact problematic!) if we were
to ask Maven to `compile` it with our project `.jar`.
That's why we use `provided`.**
