### 1.2 - `artifactId`
###### required: `yes`
_If you are planning to deploy your plugins to a public
repository (excluding JitPack), it is vital (and generally
required) that this tag match best practices. I will describe
best practices as well as acceptable values and why it may
be easier to follow best practice in any case._

_Module?_ For simplicity, I will refer to both entire
single-module projects and the individual modules of
multi-module projects as `modules`.

#### Best Practice
The `<artifactId>` is a module's name in all-lowercase.
Hyphens are allowed and preferred over camelCasing.
Multi-module projects must not repeat both group ID and
artifact ID in different modules.

The artifact ID is by default by Maven in combination
with `version` to name the file (if any) produced by the
build process.

#### Bare Minimum
Use an alphanumeric string (including hyphens, cannot start
with digits) unique to the project (and module).
