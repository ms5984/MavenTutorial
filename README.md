## A Maven Tutorial (for Spigot Plugin Development)
This project is made up of a collection of Markdown files
covering in brief how I've learned to use Maven in the
context of Spigot plugin development. It is designed for
newcomers to get exposed much faster to the concepts,
challenges, quirks and details of Maven which took months
for me to happen upon and learn from on my own.

I reference the official documentation frequently, and I
highly recommend it as an encyclopedic resource:
##### The POM: https://maven.apache.org/pom.html
