## Welcome to Maven!
Maven is a wonderful tool to use for managing a Java
project's compile-time dependencies, build process
(including required unit tests and Javadoc generation)
and common project metadata. It can carefully control
the process of including external dependencies into
your `.jar` and facilitate project deployment to a
public (or not!) repository.

This guide will cover the following topics:
### 1. POM (Project Object Model) `pom.xml` Basics
### 2. The `<build>` tag (Controlling the build process)
### 3. POM Metadata
### 4. POM Profiles
### 5. Deploying a project
### 6. Maven command line
