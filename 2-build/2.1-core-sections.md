### 2.1: Overview of core sections
#### `<plugins>`
###### required: `no, but recommended`
This section is where we can define the Maven plugins used
for the build and doubly serves as the section where those
plugins are configured.

##### What is a Maven plugin?
Maven plugins provide the features of Maven using a modular
approach. We will be using two plugins native to Maven:
- `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin`
- `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-shade-plugin`

These plugins are responsible for source compilation and
resource inclusion, respectively; in my example I will
configure them for an example environment.

#### `<resources>`
###### required: `no, but recommended`
This section allows us to include otherwise arbitrary files
(like our plugin.yml) in the final `.jar` and reference
project information easily and even selectively.
