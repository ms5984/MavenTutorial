### 2.2 - `maven-compiler-plugin`
###### required: `no, but preferred`
#### `<source>` and `<target>`
Maven and the plugins which make up the build system are
older than Java 8. However, `spigot-api` is built against
Java 8. If you do not communicate to Maven that the build
system must be able to handle at least Java 8 code, the
build will fail.

The Maven compiler plugin provides a simple configuration
format for this:
```xml
<project>
    <properties>
        <java.version>1.8</java.version>
    </properties>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>${java.version}</source>
                    <target>${java.version}</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
```
_Note, I am making special use of the `java.version`
property automatically bootstrapped by the IntelliJ
Minecraft Development plugin._

`<source>` is used to check that your code works with a
specific language level. Examples for Minecraft:
- `1.8` - Java 8
- `11` - Java 11
- `16` - Java 16
- `17` - Java 17

`<target>` is used to control the minimum version of JVM
environment that the produced `.jar` should expect (and
allow itself) to run on. In theory, this provides freedom
for the compiler to optimize older-version source code
using features present in the specified newer runtime(s).

**This tag uses the same values as `<source>`.**

#### `<encoding>` (using magic property default)
The Java compiler--and by extension, Maven--has generally
left the worry of default source file encoding to the host
system and its defaults. This creates a perfect storm for
Windows hosts--more and more software demands full Unicode
support--and Minecraft is no exception, most infamously with
its use of the section sign character (`ยง`) for chat colors.

**It is thus imperative to declare UTF-8 encoding for any
Spigot project, and we can do so by adding the following
magic property:**
```xml
    <!-- in pom.xml -->
    <properties>
        <java.version>1.8</java.version>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    </properties>
```
This works because of the default implementation for
`<encoding>`, as illustrated here:
```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <!-- You don't need to write this line, this is just for illustration -->
                    <encoding>${project.build.sourceEncoding}</encoding>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```
